# Docker and CodeBuild
- Docker is an open-source technology which allows you to create applications based on either Linux or Windows containers
- a container is a lightweight standalone executables software package which includes everything the software needs to run code, runtime environment, libraries, environment settings etc.
- AWS provides Elastic Container Service as a fully managed clustered platform which allows you to run your Docker images in the cloud
- AWS CodeBuild is a fully manage build service which runs a set of commands that you define e.g. compiles code runs tests and produces artifacts that are ready to deploy
