# Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
- a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud
- reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, allowing quick scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements change
- changes the economics of computing by allowing you to pay only for capacity that you actually use
- provides developers the tools to build failure resilient applications & isolate themselves from common failure scenarios

## Payment Options
- On Demand - allows you to pay fixed rate by the hour or by the second with no commitment
- Reserved - provides you with a capacity reservation adn offer a significant discount on the hourly charge for an instance (1 to 3 year terms)
- Spot - enables you to bid whatever price you want for instance capacity, providing for even greater savings if your applications have flexible start and end times
- Dedicated Hosts - physical EC2 server dedicated for your use; they can help you reduce costs by allowing you to use your existing server-bound software licenses

## On Demand
- perfect for user that want the low cost and flexibility without any up-front payment or long-term commitment
- application with short term, spiky or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted
- applications being developed or tested on Amazon EC2 for the first time
- great for learning because you provision instances as you need it and then turn them off when you don't
