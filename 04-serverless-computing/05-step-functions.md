# Step Functions
- allows you to visualize and test your serverless applications
- provides a graphical console to arrand and visualize the components of your application as a series of steps
  - makes it simple to build and run multi-step applications
- automatically triggers and tracks each step and retries when there are errors so your application executes in order and as expected
- logs the state of each step so when things go wrong you can diagnose and debug problems quickly

## Step Function Design Patterns
- sequential
- branching steps (choice of path)
- parallel steps
